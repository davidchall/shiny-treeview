Each example below is written using the [Shiny Express](https://shiny.posit.co/py/api/express/)
syntax, a concise API for [Shiny for Python](https://shiny.posit.co/py/).
The more powerful [Shiny Core](https://shiny.posit.co/py/api/core/) API is also supported.

The examples run in your web browser using [Shinylive](https://shiny.posit.co/py/get-started/shinylive.html),
which means you can quickly test ideas by editing the source code and re-running the app.

## Basic usage

Try playing around with the `multiple` and `selected` arguments.

::: column-page-inset-right
```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: horizontal
#| viewerHeight: 500

## file: app.py
{{< include "examples/basic/app.py" >}}

## file: data.py
{{< include "examples/basic/data.py" >}}

## file: requirements.txt
{{< include "examples/basic/requirements.txt" >}}
```


## Checkbox selection

When checkboxes are enabled, a tree item is selected by clicking on the checkbox element.
Consequently a tree item can be expanded without selecting it.

::: column-page-inset-right
```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: horizontal
#| viewerHeight: 500

## file: app.py
{{< include "examples/checkbox/app.py" >}}

## file: data.py
{{< include "examples/basic/data.py" >}}

## file: requirements.txt
{{< include "examples/checkbox/requirements.txt" >}}
```
